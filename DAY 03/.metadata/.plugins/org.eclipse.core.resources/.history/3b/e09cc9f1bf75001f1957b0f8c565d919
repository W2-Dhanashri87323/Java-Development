 * Author   :: Rajvardhan Patil
 * Question ::Create a class called Date that includes three instance variables—a 
month (type int), a day (type int) and a year (type int). Provide a constructor 
that initializes the three instance variables and assumes that the values 
provided are correct. Provide a set and a get method for each instance 
variable. Provide a method displayDate that displays the month, day and 
year separated by forward slashes (/). Write a test application named 
DateTest that demonstrates class Date’s capabilities.
